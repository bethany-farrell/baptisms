The Assumption Catholic Church in Windsor, Ontario began as the ""Mission des Hurons de la Pointe de Montréal du Détroit,"" located in the western part of Essex County along the Detroit River.  In 1765, the mission became the parish of ""L'Assomption de la Pointe de Montréal du Détroit.""   In 1792, ""La Pointe de Montréal"" became Sandwich Township and the parish was also known as ""L'Assomption de Sandwich.""  In 1796, Detroit became part of the United States and some families from Detroit moved to Sandwich Township at that time. The area of Sandwich Township became the townships of Sandwich South, Sandwich West and Sandwich East in 1854.  The village of Windsor was established in 1835 in Sandwich Township and became a town in 1858.  The town of Sandwich was also created in 1858 and was annexed by Windsor in 1935.  Ontario was known as ""Upper Canada"" from 1791 to 1841.  Previously to 1791, the area was part of the Province of Canada.",
